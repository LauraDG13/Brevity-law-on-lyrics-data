# ZipfÂ´s Law of Abbreviation on lyrics data
Testing Zipf's Law of Abbreviation on English and Spanish lyrics

Zipf's Law of Abbreviation, theorized by the linguist George Kingsley Zipf, states that there is an inverse relationship between a word's length and frequency; the more frequent a word is, the shorter it tends to be. Zipf claimed that it's a universal property of human language; for this reason, we can find it in a wide range of human languages. According to the linguist, this phenomenon is the result of a tradeoff between two individual needs: the need of the need for better understanding and the need for efficient communication (Principle of Least Effort). 

This project finds the principles of Zipf's Law of Abbreviation in both dataset, giving some insights about the universality of the phenomenon.
